## Status of the extension
I am currently pretty busy and dont have time to work on the extension.
Right now expansion of new sources and new features is quite limited because the original code was not made for such a complex purpose.
Because of this, I am rewriting the core code, this part is mostly done but I now need to add the new features and test the extension.

The progress is slow, but I will finish one day!
Thank you for your support ❤️
